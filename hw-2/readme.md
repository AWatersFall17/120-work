## Report

In the homework assignment for week 2, I compared the different programs discussed throughout the assignment, and made my choices to use a specific set that I felt comfortable with based on user friendliness and interface. I ended up going with the programs listed below.

- Windows PowerShell
- Atom
- GitHub Desktop

I believe I will continue using them throughout the rest of the class, and even though the programs proved to be challenging, the interfaces seem more user friendly then the others mentioned throughout this week's lesson. It was particularly interesting to learn how these programs can be so deeply connected, as I moved through each part of the assigment.

For this week, I think comparing the different programs and different methods was the most time consuming part of the assignment. There were a lot of things to consider with each program, and it was also important to think about how they would interact with one another. My method of comparison was broken down, in order, as follows:

1. Compared Windows Command and PowerShell by testing out simple commands and user customizability.
  - I began with Windows Command, but found I prefered PowerShell after a few playing around with a few more examples.
2. Compared Text Editors based on interface and cost, and chose Atom.
3. Compared Git version--Windows vs. GitHub Desktop and chose the Desktop application.
4. Completed assignment and multiple examples to make sure I felt comfortable with the programs I'd chosen.

Once I'd made my initial decision about which programs to use, I followed the steps listed throughout the assignment, making sure to find a level of comfort at each task before moving on to the next step. I did run into some issues with trying to remember how to create new directories. I had to go back and review code `mkdir filename` but I have made some extra notes that *that* is usually the code I typically forget how to enter.

I'm learning how much creativity you can potentially have access to through coding as you can change things like font and color and size, etc. I'm curious how deep the rabbit hole goes. Exactly how much control do you have over the artistic capabilities of coding? I'm excited to find out.
